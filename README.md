I have relocated my practice to Richmond Hill, ON. I am no longer practising at Richmond University Vision Care and Dr. Jarrett & Associates in Scarborough effective November 17, 2017.  
 
As my patient, it is important you know the options available to receive ongoing optometric care.
 
These options are:

* Remain at Richmond University Vision Care and/or Dr. Jarrett & Associates and transfer care to the current optometrists-on-staff at these clinics.

* Transfer to another practice in the area. Please visit the College of Optometrists of Ontario (<https://www.collegeoptom.on.ca/>) and click on the tab “Find An Optometrist” for a list of current practising optometrists.

* Continue your optometric care with Dr. Norris Lam in Richmond Hill (Yonge / Major Mackenzie)

Dr. Norris Lam’s new practice address is  
**Richmond Hill Eye Associates 
(Yonge / Major Mackenzie)  
104 – 10350 Yonge St, Richmond Hill, ON L4C 5K9  
T: (905) 884-0061**
 
**A personal note from Dr. Norris Lam...**  
It has been my great pleasure and honour to have provided you with my service. It is my wish for you to continue receiving the highest quality of care. I hope that we can meet again in the future. Best wishes for a healthy future.
